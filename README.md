HR Analytics Dashboard (Excel)

Overview

This project is my first interactive HR Analytics Dashboard, created after completing the ALX Data Analytics Program. The goal of this analysis was to explore workforce patterns, understand employee attrition, and identify the key factors influencing turnover within the organization.

The dashboard was built entirely in Microsoft Excel, using techniques such as data cleaning, pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers to create an insightful and user-friendly visualization.

🔍 Key Insights
1. High Attrition Rate

The organization has an attrition rate of 16%, which is above the healthy benchmark for most industries.

This suggests a need to investigate employee satisfaction and workplace engagement.

2. Low Job Satisfaction

Average job satisfaction score is 2.6 / 5, indicating that employees may not feel supported, valued, or motivated.

3. Younger Employees Are Leaving the Most

Employees aged 25–34 represent the highest attrition segment.

This age group typically seeks career growth, development opportunities, and competitive compensation.

4. Highly Educated Employees Are More Mobile

Most attrition comes from employees with Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.

These individuals often have more job alternatives and may be seeking better career alignment.

5. Department & Role Patterns

Sales has the highest department-level attrition, followed by technical roles such as Laboratory Technician and Research Scientist.

HR remains relatively stable with the lowest turnover.

6. Workforce Composition

Employee distribution is approximately 60% male and 40% female.

Gender does not appear to significantly influence attrition in this dataset.
